Todo:
# descriptions and info boxes for the tool
# descriptions of graphs, descriptions of the info in each output (see Seasonal Characterization Slides that were shared)
# progress bar for process?
# view results barplot should have the x axis be qualitative- i.e. a bar for each site
# when creating graphs, generate the data to be turned into graphs ahead of time, and switch which one is shown with the button
  (don't continually run the same code to generate the graphs from scratch every time they're selected)
# be able to select genetics in the visualizations

# internally:
# make N/A sowing dates a viable choice

3. option to select a folder where to put the results
